feat: add relation_members geometry type for processing OSM relation members

Add a new `geometry: relation_members` option to YAML custom maps that
allows processing individual members of OSM relations as separate features.
Instead of emitting one feature per relation, this emits one feature per
qualifying member, using each member's geometry and tags.

Key features:
- Select relations using existing include_when/exclude_when filters
- Emit one feature per qualifying member (way/node)
- Filter members by type, role, and tags (with inline script support)
- Add member-level attributes from member tags
- Support inline script expressions for member filtering and attributes

New configuration fields:
- member_types: Filter members by OSM element type (node, way, relation)
- member_roles: Filter members by their role in the relation
- member_include_when: Filter members by their tags (structured or inline script)
- member_exclude_when: Exclude members by their tags (structured or inline script)
- member_attributes: Add attributes from member tags (with inline script support)

Implementation follows the multipolygon processing pattern:
- Phase 1: Identify relations matching relation_members features
- Phase 2: Store member geometries/tags, then process relations to emit member features

Includes comprehensive validation:
- Member fields can only be used with relation_members geometry
- member_types values must be valid OSM element types
- Clear error messages for invalid configurations

Resolves #1426
